# 👋 Hey, I’m Felix.

- 👀 I’m interested in technology and gaming.
  - [I make tech videos and articles and stream games sometimes!](https://www.techlifeyt.com/links/)
- 📚 I’m currently learning C#, and am familiar with Python.
  - I've been using Python for a couple of years now, and <3 it :]
- 🎯 Currently, my main project is [TechBot](https://www.techlifeyt.com/invite-techbot/)- my Discord bot.
  - It's a pretty small bot but it's got some neat features. [It'd be pretty neat if you checked it out](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/techbot-8514)!
- 📫 You can find me everywhere else [here](https://www.techlifeyt.com/felixyates/).
  - If it's a private account, I probably won't accept you there unless I know you. Sorry!
